This is a personal website to showcase my work and share my experience as a developer.

Feel free to fork the repo and improve on it for your own use. If you want to use my template, you can simply modify these files:
- [gatsby-config.js](gatsby-config.js)
- [gatsby-node.js](gatsby-node.js)
- Rename [config.example.js](src/utils/config.example.js) to `config.js`
- Initialize a firebase project and edit [.firebaserc](.firebaserc)

Powered by React, Gatsby, and Firebase.

# Deployment
Just run
```

```
and GitHub Action will handle the rest
